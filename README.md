### FYI :
- You have to complete all the coding problems.
- Read the questions, there are some code here and there for you guys to spend time with. Try to understand them how they are working.
- Feel free to google. But don't feel free to copy and paste the answer. Try to understand and implement the answers. 
- I would have somebody randomly picked from the class and ask to present on one problem's solution from their submission of the midterm on coming tuesday.
